              Completed my studies in Bachelor of Computer Science in Software
              Engineering with 2 years of experience developing and maintaining
              software applications. I have focused on server-side development
              and I am eager to transition my skills to full-stack development.
              Throughout my tenure, I have honed my skills in backend
              development, including implementing and maintaining scalable
              server-side solutions. My passion for expanding my expertise has
              led me to enroll in the Full Stack Developer Program under Yayasan
              Pahang, which I expect to complete by the end of October.
